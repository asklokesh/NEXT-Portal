  type: api_key
  header_name: "X-API-Key"
  key_location: "environment_variable"
  environment_variable: "NEXTPORTAL_API_KEY"
  
# Example OAuth 2.0 Configuration  
authentication:
  type: oauth2
  grant_type: "client_credentials"
  client_id: "${OAUTH_CLIENT_ID}"
  client_secret: "${OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET}"
  token_url: "https://auth.company.com/oauth/token"
  scope: "nextportal:read nextportal:write"
```

**Rate Limiting and Error Handling:**
```yaml

  burst_limit: 100
  retry_policy:
    max_retries: 3
    backoff_strategy: "exponential"
    base_delay: 1000  # milliseconds
    max_delay: 30000  # milliseconds

# Error Handling Configuration
error_handling:
  retry_on_status_codes: [429, 500, 502, 503, 504]
  circuit_breaker:
    failure_threshold: 5
    recovery_timeout: 30000  # milliseconds

    <saml:SPSSODescriptor 
        AuthnRequestsSigned="true"
        WantAssertionsSigned="true"
        protocolSupportEnumeration="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol">
        
        <saml:SingleLogoutService 
            Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
            Location="https://nextportal.company.com/saml/sls"/>
            
        <saml:AssertionConsumerService 
            index="1" 
            isDefault="true"
            Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
            Location="https://nextportal.company.com/saml/acs"/>
