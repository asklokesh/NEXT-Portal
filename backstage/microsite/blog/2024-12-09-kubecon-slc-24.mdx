My friends, what an intense conference!

Over the course of three packed days, there were a bunch of activities, including talks, a kiosk, and a Contribfest, all centered around Backstage.

### Maintainers take the stage

![Backstage maintainers presenting in a ballroom](assets/2024-12-09/kc24slc-spotify-maintainers.jpg)

This may be old hat for those who are regular KubeCon attendees, but it’s still pretty exciting to catch up on all the Backstage updates straight from the core maintainers. Spotify’s Ben Lambert and Patrik Oldsberg were in the spotlight in Ballroom C addressing an attentive crowd of Backstage adopters, users, and fans.

Highlights of their maintainers talk include:

- **Project updates:** Yarn 4 is now the default, the new built-in event bus has arrived, and the (New) Backend System is now 1.0!
- **Security Audit:** Another security audit has been completed with the helpful support of the CNCF
- **Scaffolder updates:** Addition of Form Decorators and support for Retries!
- **New Frontend System:** Focus on the plugin builder experience!

Watch their entire talk — “[How to Expand Your IDP: The New Building Blocks of Backstage](https://youtu.be/BzPCJMQH8tg?list=PL8iP9yIjU0Q3UUDXdAoCaTC4Ci8asWg-X)” — for all the details.

### Toyota and Akamai in the house

There were great talks from Backstage adopters during KubeCon, too. Toyota and Akamai packed the rooms with their Backstage knowledge.

- “[Shifting Gears: Leveraging CNCF Tools to Streamline Operations at Toyota Connected][toyota]”: Benson and Rob talk about failures and successes adopting CNCF tools (including ArgoCD and Backstage) to unify operations, streamline workflows, and enhance cross-team collaboration.

- “[From Chaos to Calm: Building a Unified and Scalable CI/CD Pipeline at Akamai][akamai]”: Tomer dives into development efficiency and how you can “conquer cloud-native deployments by adding the right tools, such as Argo Rollouts and Backstage”.

### And the award goes to…

Adobe gave a shoutout to Backstage from the Keynote mainstage on Thursday morning when they (spoiler alert) [accepted the CNCF’s Top End User Award][keynote], thanking the cloud native community and all the projects that they use.

But Adobe isn’t just a Backstage adopter, they are a model citizen — giving back to the community through their example, having “developed a reference architecture for its IDP, built using Argo, Backstage, Helm, and Kubernetes, which other organizations can use as a template for designing and implementing their systems”.

As Taylor Dolezal, head of ecosystem at the CNCF, [says][announcement]: “Their commitment to nurturing technological excellence and developer experience exemplifies what we hope to see in the end user ecosystem. It’s not just about tool adoption or code contributions — it’s about synthesizing these learnings into assets that empower others in their cloud native journeys.”

Way to go, Adobe!

### A bustling CNCF project pavilion

 [CNCF](https://www.flickr.com/photos/143247548@N03/albums/72177720321905538/)

The CNCF Projects Pavilion was buzzing with activity all week, and the Backstage kiosk was a hub of excitement. Attendees stopped by with a mix of curiosity and enthusiasm, sparking conversations that highlighted the dynamic nature of our community.

Curious visitors asked, “What is Backstage all about?”, while adopters sought personalized advice on customizing Backstage for their specific company needs. Contributors dropped in to say, “Hey, you reviewed my pull request!” And professionals proudly shared their achievements as Backstage experts — in fact, now there’s a way to make that expertise official — by becoming a [Certified Backstage Associate (CBA)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/blog/just-launched-certified-backstage-associate-cba/), a new certification that was just launched by the CNCF and The Linux Foundation.

Developers eager to give back to the community came to learn how to start contributing, and some of the kindest Backstage fans simply stopped by to say, “Thank you”. Their gratitude and encouragement are a powerful reminder of why we do what we do.

Every interaction in person made the day special, and we wrapped up with a deep sense of fulfillment and pride in how far Backstage has come. Here's to building an even brighter future together!

## Contribfest! It’s All About Community

![Various developers and their laptops participating in the Backstage Contribfest](assets/2024-12-09/kc24slc-spotify-cncf-contribfest.gif)

On Thursday, the first-ever Backstage Contribfest session took place — hosted by Yi Cai and Paul Schultz from Red Hat, and André Wanlin, Patrik Oldsberg, and Ben Lambert from Spotify.

Participants who hadn't yet used or contributed to Backstage eagerly joined the project's contributors community and were eager to help. Together with the group, experienced Backstage engineers stepped in to assist attendees — whether troubleshooting environment setup or explaining how specific framework and plugin features are implemented. It was a great example of a community coming together to support learning and contribution.

The energy in the room, with 60 enthusiastic participants, was absolutely electric! It was amazing to see ideas bouncing around, impromptu collaboration happening at every corner, and a shared passion for advancing the Backstage project.

Among the great contributions to come out of this event are:

- [Add Pagination to Tech Docs Table](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/27694)
- [Add Home Page Quick Start Card](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/27705)
- [Truncate commit message to first newline](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/pull/2012)

A heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us — it’s your talent and collaborative spirit that truly define the Backstage community. This event was a powerful reminder that it’s the people behind the project who make Backstage what it is today .

And if you missed out on the fun, it's never too late to join the Backstage community. Just follow along with the [Contribfest slide deck](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/kccncna2024/53/KubeCon-ContribFest-Backstage-NA-2024.pdf) to get started with contributing!

## Bonus pups!
