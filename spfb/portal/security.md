# Security

Enterprise-grade security is fundamental to Spotify Portal for Backstage. This document outlines security features, best practices, and compliance considerations.

## Core Security Features

### Data Protection & Encryption

**Encryption at Rest**
- Portal encrypts your Backstage configuration using `aes-256-cbc` when stored in the database
- Database-level encryption for all sensitive data including secrets, tokens, and user information
- Encrypted backups with secure key management
- Hardware security module (HSM) support for enterprise deployments

**Encryption in Transit**
- TLS 1.3 encryption for all client-server communications
- Certificate management with automatic renewal
- Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) for enhanced security
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data flows

### Authentication & Authorization

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Support for TOTP, SMS, and hardware security keys
- Conditional MFA based on risk assessment
- Backup codes for account recovery
- Enterprise SSO integration with MFA enforcement

**Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration**
- SAML 2.0 with enterprise identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0)
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern authentication flows
- LDAP/Active Directory integration for legacy systems
- Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning for automatic user creation

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Granular permission management at resource level
- Team-based access controls with inheritance
- Dynamic permissions based on user attributes
- Audit trails for all permission changes

### Security Monitoring & Compliance

**Audit Logging**
- Comprehensive audit trails for all user actions
- Immutable log storage with tamper detection
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Integration with SIEM systems (Splunk, Elastic, QRadar)

**Vulnerability Management**
- Automatic dependency scanning and updates
- Container image security scanning
- Regular penetration testing and security assessments
- CVE monitoring and patch management

**Compliance Frameworks**
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- ISO 27001 compliance
- GDPR data protection compliance
- HIPAA compliance for healthcare organizations
- FedRAMP authorization for government deployments

## Security Architecture

### Network Security

**Infrastructure Protection**
- VPC isolation with private subnets
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
- DDoS protection and rate limiting
- IP whitelisting and geographic restrictions

**API Security**
- OAuth 2.0 and JWT token authentication
- API rate limiting and throttling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) protection

### Application Security

**Secure Development Practices**
- Security-first development lifecycle
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

**Runtime Protection**
- Container security scanning and runtime protection
- Kubernetes security policies and network policies
- Secret management with vault integration
- Secure configuration management

## Risk Management

### Known Security Considerations

**Administrative Access**
- Root admin login page requires additional protection when active
- Should only be used for initial setup and recovery operations
- Multi-factor authentication required for admin access
- Session timeout and activity monitoring

**Denial of Service Protection**
- Rate limiting at application and infrastructure levels
- Traffic analysis and anomaly detection
- Geographic traffic filtering
- CDN integration for traffic distribution

**Data Privacy**
- Data minimization principles
- Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)
- Data portability and export capabilities
- Privacy impact assessments

### Incident Response

**Security Incident Management**
- 24/7 security operations center (SOC) monitoring
- Automated incident detection and alerting
- Incident response playbooks and procedures
- Forensic analysis and evidence collection

**Business Continuity**
- Disaster recovery planning and testing
- Business continuity procedures
- Data backup and restoration
- Alternative access methods during incidents

## Security Best Practices

### Deployment Security

**Infrastructure Hardening**
- Minimal attack surface with least privilege principles
- Regular security patching and updates
- Secure configuration baselines
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning

**Container Security**
- Non-root container execution
- Image vulnerability scanning
- Runtime security monitoring
- Secure container registries

### Operational Security

**Access Management**
- Regular access reviews and recertification
- Privileged access management (PAM)
- Service account lifecycle management
- Emergency access procedures

**Monitoring & Alerting**
- Real-time security monitoring
- Anomaly detection and behavioral analysis
- Security metrics and KPI tracking
- Executive security dashboards

### Developer Security

**Secure Coding Practices**
- Security training and awareness programs
- Code review with security focus
- Threat modeling for new features
- Security testing in CI/CD pipelines

**Secret Management**
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Automated secret rotation
- Secret scanning in repositories
- Secure secret distribution
