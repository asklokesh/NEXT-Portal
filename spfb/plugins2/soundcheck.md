- **Technical Debt Monitoring**: Identify and prioritize technical debt reduction efforts

## Core Concepts

Soundcheck is built on five fundamental elements that work together to provide comprehensive quality management:

### 1. Checks
**Definition**: A specific standard or best practice that a component is evaluated against

**Examples**:
- Repository has a README file
- Code coverage exceeds 80%
- No high-severity security vulnerabilities
- Service has monitoring and alerting configured
- Documentation is up-to-date

**Check Types**:
- **Static Checks**: Evaluate static properties (documentation, configuration)
- **Dynamic Checks**: Assess runtime behavior (performance, uptime)
- **Integration Checks**: Verify external integrations (monitoring, CI/CD)
- **Security Checks**: Validate security posture and compliance

### 2. Check Results
**Definition**: The outcome of evaluating a check against a component

**Result Types**:
- **Pass**: Component meets the standard
- **Fail**: Component does not meet the standard
- **Warning**: Component partially meets the standard
- **Not Applicable**: Check doesn't apply to this component
- **Unknown**: Check couldn't be evaluated

**Result Metadata**:
- Timestamp of evaluation
- Evidence and supporting data
- Remediation suggestions
- Historical trend information

### 3. Tracks
**Definition**: Long-term tech health initiatives that group related quality objectives

**Standard Tracks**:
- **Basic Health**: Fundamental hygiene and documentation standards
- **Security**: Security vulnerabilities, secrets management, and compliance
- **Reliability**: Testing, monitoring, error handling, and operational readiness
- **Performance**: Performance benchmarks, optimization, and efficiency
- **Cost Efficiency**: Resource optimization and cost management
- **Maintainability**: Code quality, dependency management, and refactoring

**Custom Tracks**:
- Organization-specific quality initiatives
- Industry compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Technology-specific standards (mobile, ML, data)
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, SOX)

### 4. Levels
**Definition**: Milestone groups of checks within a track that represent achievement stages

**Level Structure**:
- **Bronze**: Basic compliance and minimum standards
- **Silver**: Intermediate quality with enhanced practices
- **Gold**: Advanced quality with best-in-class practices
- **Custom Levels**: Organization-defined achievement tiers

**Level Benefits**:
- Clear progression paths for teams
- Gamification of quality improvements
- Recognition and incentive programs
- Executive visibility into quality maturity

### 5. Certifications
**Definition**: Formal recognition achieved by passing all checks within a level

**Certification Features**:
- **Badge System**: Visual indicators of achievement levels
- **Expiration Dates**: Time-bound certifications requiring renewal
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history of certification status
- **Automated Notifications**: Alerts for certification changes

    // Custom evaluation logic
    const hasSecurityConfig = await this.validateSecurityConfig(entity);
    
    return {
      status: hasSecurityConfig ? 'pass' : 'fail',
      message: hasSecurityConfig 
        ? 'Security configuration validated'
        : 'Security configuration missing or invalid',
