2. 🔄 **Remediation Phase 1** - address critical security gaps (2 weeks)
3. 📋 **Compliance implementation** - achieve SOC 2 compliance (1 month)
4. 🚀 **Production deployment** - with comprehensive security controls

### Success Criteria for Production Release
- ✅ Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ SOC 2 Type 1 compliance achieved
