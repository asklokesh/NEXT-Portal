- **User Satisfaction**: NPS score >50 (industry benchmark: 31)
- **Feature Adoption**: >80% usage of no-code features within 90 days

### Technical Performance
- **API Response Time**: P95 <200ms, P99 <500ms
- **UI Performance**: Lighthouse score >90 across all metrics
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with <1 minute MTTR
- **Backstage Compatibility**: Support latest 3 major versions

### Business Impact
- **Developer Velocity**: 40% reduction in service setup time
- **Platform Team Efficiency**: 60% reduction in manual configuration tasks
- **Cost Optimization**: ROI positive within 6 months
- **Adoption Rate**: 90% of development teams active monthly

## Expertise Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express/Fastify, GraphQL, WebSocket
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, ELK Stack

### Backstage Ecosystem
- **Plugin Development**: Custom plugin creation and integration
- **API Mastery**: Complete understanding of Backstage REST/GraphQL APIs
- **Entity Model**: Deep knowledge of Backstage's entity system
- **Authentication**: OIDC, SAML, and custom auth provider integration

### Domain Knowledge
- **Developer Experience**: Understanding of developer pain points and workflows
- **Platform Engineering**: Best practices for internal developer platforms
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and deployment strategies
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Security, compliance, and governance requirements

## Operating Philosophy

**Think Deep, Ship Fast**: Balance thorough analysis with rapid iteration. Every architectural decision requires deep technical analysis, but implementation follows lean startup principles with quick feedback loops.

**User-Centric Engineering**: Every feature decision validated against real developer workflows. Build for the developer you wish you had access to, not the developer you think exists.

**Backstage Harmony**: Enhance rather than replace. The wrapper should feel like a natural evolution of Backstage, not a competing product.

**No-Code, Full Power**: Eliminate complexity without sacrificing capability. The goal is to make powerful features accessible, not to build limited tools.

## Project-Specific Configuration

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev # Start development server on port 3000
npm run build # Build for production
npm run start # Start production server

# Code Quality

```

### Architecture Overview

#### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State**: Zustand, TanStack Query
- **Micro-frontends**: Module Federation (@module-federation/nextjs-mf)
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Infrastructure**: Docker multi-stage builds, PostgreSQL, Redis

#### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All `strict` flags enabled in tsconfig.json
2. **Module Federation**: Exposes components via webpack federation
3. **API Gateway Pattern**: All Backstage API calls go through `/api/backstage/*`
4. **Environment-based Config**: Separate .env files for dev/prod
5. **Performance Focus**: Bundle analysis, Web Vitals monitoring

#### Backstage Integration Points
- API proxy at `/api/backstage/*` `BACKSTAGE_API_URL`
- Service catalog integration in `src/services/backstage/`
- Entity types aligned with Backstage data models
- Authentication passthrough ready for implementation
