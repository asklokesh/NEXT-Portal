# Agent Instructions - Backstage IDP Platform Development

## Project Context & Vision

### Original Directive
The user initiated this project with a clear vision: **"Create an enterprise-grade UI wrapper and no-code platform for Backstage.io"**. The goal was to make Backstage accessible to platform teams without requiring extensive coding knowledge, while maintaining 100% compatibility with the Backstage backend.

### Core Philosophy
**"We are just a backstage UI wrapper but use everything from backstage.io backend with no code approach for platform team and developers to easily maintain, configure and manage everything in this developer portal that is going to be industry leading because this is never done before and backstage.io is not super plug and play and easy unless you code so much to make it for a company"**

### Critical Requirements
1. **No-code approach** - Everything must be configurable through UI
2. **Don't break anything** - Only enhance and modify based on requirements
3. **Performance at scale** - Must support 500+ concurrent users
4. **Enterprise-grade** - Production-ready, not a prototype
