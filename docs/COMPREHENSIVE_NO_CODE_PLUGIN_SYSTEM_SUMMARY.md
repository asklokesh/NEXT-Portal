Indexes 340+ Backstage plugins from multiple sources - NPM registry integration (@backstage, @roadiehq, community plugins) - GitHub repository analysis - Quality scoring and health assessment - Real-time metadata aggregation 2. **No-Code Configuration Manager** (`/src/components/plugins/NoCodeConfigurationManager.tsx`) - Dynamic form generation from plugin schemas - Visual configuration with drag-and-drop interface - Real-time validation and preview - Environment-specific configurations - Export/import functionality 3. **Automated Plugin Installer** (`/src/services/plugins/automated-plugin-installer.ts`) - Zero-downtime plugin installation - Automatic dependency resolution - Security scanning and validation - Rollback capabilities - Progress tracking with real-time updates 4. **SaaS Deployment Orchestrator** (`/src/services/plugins/saas-deployment-orchestrator.ts`) - Multi-tenant deployment management - Kubernetes integration - Auto-scaling and resource management - Container orchestration - Cross-region deployment support 5. **Enterprise Governance Service** (`/src/services/plugins/enterprise-governance.ts`) - Approval workflows - Security scanning and compliance - Policy enforcement - Audit trails - Risk assessment 6. **Real-Time Monitoring & Auto-Recovery** (`/src/services/plugins/realtime-plugin-monitor.ts`) - Health monitoring - Performance metrics - Intelligent alerting - Auto-recovery mechanisms - WebSocket-based real-time updates ## Key Features ### Visual Plugin Marketplace - **Spotify Portal-like UI**: Beautiful, intuitive interface for browsing 340+ plugins - **Smart Search & Filtering**: Category-based browsing, advanced filters, quality scoring - **Plugin Details**: Comprehensive information including health scores, dependencies, reviews - **One-Click Installation**: Install plugins without technical knowledge ### No-Code Configuration - **Dynamic Form Generation**: Automatically generates configuration forms from plugin schemas - **Visual Configuration Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for complex configurations - **Real-Time Validation**: Instant feedback and error checking - **Configuration Templates**: Pre-built templates for common scenarios - **Export/Import**: Save and share configurations ### Enterprise-Grade Deployment - **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Isolated deployments per tenant - **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on load - **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Rolling updates without service interruption - **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes-based deployment management - **Geographic Distribution**: Deploy across multiple regions ### Governance & Security - **Approval Workflows**: Customizable approval processes for different environments - **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection and compliance checking - **Policy Enforcement**: Rule-based governance with exceptions management - **Audit Trails**: Complete history of all plugin operations - **Risk Assessment**: Intelligent risk scoring for deployments ### Real-Time Monitoring - **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with auto-recovery - **Performance Metrics**: CPU, memory, response time, error rates - **Intelligent Alerting**: Smart alerts with escalation policies - **Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of plugin status and metrics - **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic healing of failed plugin instances ## File Structure ``` src/ ├── app/ │ ├── api/ │ │ └── plugins/ │ │ ├── comprehensive/route.ts # Unified API endpoint │ │ └── [id]/schema/route.ts # Plugin schema API │ └── plugins/ │ └── comprehensive/page.tsx # Main dashboard ├── components/ │ └── plugins/ │ ├── SpotifyPortalMarketplace.tsx # Visual marketplace │ ├── NoCodeConfigurationManager.tsx # Configuration UI │ ├── PluginMarketplace.tsx # Enhanced marketplace │ └── PluginManagementDashboard.tsx # Management interface └── services/ └── plugins/ ├── comprehensive-plugin-registry.ts # Plugin indexing ├── automated-plugin-installer.ts # Installation service ├── saas-deployment-orchestrator.ts # Deployment management ├── enterprise-governance.ts # Governance features └── realtime-plugin-monitor.ts # Monitoring service ``` ## Integration Points ### API Endpoints 1. **Comprehensive Plugin API** (`/api/plugins/comprehensive`) - `GET ?action=discover` - Search and browse plugins - `GET ?action=health` - Get plugin health status - `GET ?action=dashboard` - Get monitoring dashboard - `GET ?action=alerts` - Get active alerts - `GET ?action=approvals` - Get pending approvals - `POST action=install` - Install plugin with governance - `POST action=deploy` - Deploy plugin to environment - `POST action=configure` - Configure plugin settings - `POST action=monitor` - Setup monitoring - `POST action=scale` - Scale plugin deployment - `POST action=recovery` - Trigger auto-recovery 2. **Plugin Schema API** (`/api/plugins/[id]/schema`) - `GET` - Get configuration schema for plugin - `POST` - Update plugin schema ### Database Schema Extensions The system integrates with existing Prisma schema and adds: - Plugin metadata storage - Deployment tracking - Governance workflow state - Monitoring data - Configuration history ## Enterprise Features ### Multi-Tenant Support - Tenant isolation at infrastructure level - Resource quotas and limits - Customizable governance policies - Tenant-specific monitoring ### SaaS Deployment Ready - Kubernetes-based orchestration - Auto-scaling and load balancing - Health monitoring and auto-recovery - Cross-region deployment support - Container-based plugin isolation ### Security & Compliance - Automated security scanning - Vulnerability assessment - Compliance framework support (SOC2, ISO27001, etc.) - Policy-based governance - Audit logging and reporting ### Enterprise Governance - Multi-step approval workflows - Risk assessment and scoring - Business justification requirements - Rollback capabilities - Change tracking and audit trails ## Getting Started ### Access the System 1. **Main Dashboard**: Visit `http://localhost:4400/plugins/comprehensive` 2. **Plugin Marketplace**: Browse and install plugins with visual interface 3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time view of plugin health and performance 4. **Governance Console**: Manage approvals and compliance ### Key Workflows 1. **Plugin Discovery**: Browse marketplace → Filter by category → View details → Install 2. **Configuration**: Select plugin → Visual configuration → Preview → Save 3. **Deployment**: Choose environment → Configure resources → Deploy → Monitor 4. **Governance**: Submit request → Approval workflow → Security scan → Deploy ## Monitoring & Observability ### Real-Time Dashboard -
