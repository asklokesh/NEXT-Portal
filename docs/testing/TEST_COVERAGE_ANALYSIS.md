Fix failing cost provider tests 2. Add authentication flow tests 3. Create E2E test for critical user journey 4. Establish performance baseline 5. Set up test database #### Short-term Goals (Month 1) 1. Achieve 30% test coverage 2. Implement CI/CD test execution 3. Add integration tests for Backstage 4. Create test data fixtures 5. Document testing guidelines #### Long-term Objectives (Quarter) 1. Reach 70% test coverage 2. Implement mutation testing 3. Add chaos engineering tests 4. Establish performance regression detection 5. Create automated test generation ### Coverage Heat Map ``` src/ â”œâ”€â”€ app/ 0% - CRITICAL â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/ 0% - Recently fixed performance issues â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ catalog/ 0% - Core functionality â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ templates/ 0% - Critical path â”‚ â””â”€â”€ login/ 0% - Security critical â”œâ”€â”€ components/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ui/ ðŸŸ¡ 5% - Some skeleton tests â”‚ â””â”€â”€ dashboard/ ðŸŸ¡ 10% - WebSocket tests exist â”œâ”€â”€ services/ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ backstage/ ðŸŸ¡ 20% - Basic client tests â”œâ”€â”€ lib/ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ auth/ ðŸŸ¡ 15% - Some provider tests â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ cost/ ðŸŸ  40% - Tests exist but failing â”‚ â””â”€â”€ db/ ðŸŸ¢ 60% - Repository tests present â””â”€â”€ hooks/ 0% - No coverage ``` ### Test Debt Calculation **Technical Debt Score:** 8.5/10 (Critical) **Estimated Effort to Reach 70% Coverage:** - Developer Days: 45-60 days - Team Size Needed: 2-3 engineers - Timeline: 2-3 months **ROI Analysis:** - Current Bug Escape Rate: Unknown (no metrics) - Expected Reduction: 60-70% fewer production issues - Development Velocity Impact: +30% after initial investment - Maintenance Cost Reduction: 40% over 6 months ### Conclusion The current test coverage represents a significant production risk. With only 4.6% of files having tests and critical paths completely untested, the application is vulnerable to regressions, security issues, and performance degradation. Immediate action is required to establish a basic safety net, followed by systematic improvement to reach industry-standard coverage levels. **Priority Recommendation:** Focus on authentication, dashboard, and template execution tests immediately as these represent the highest risk to production stability and user experience.
