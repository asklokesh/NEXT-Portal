# Plugin Management Schema Enhancements

## Overview
The Prisma schema has been enhanced to support a comprehensive plugin management system with advanced features for health monitoring, resource tracking, configuration management, and multi-tenant support.

## Enhanced Plugin Model Features

### New Fields Added to Plugin Model:
- **Health Metrics**: `healthScore`, `lastHealthCheck`
- **Resource Usage**: `cpuUsage`, `memoryUsage` 
- **Installation Metadata**: `installedFrom`, `installedBy`, `installedAt`
- **Configuration Schema**: `configSchema`
- **Dependencies**: `dependencies` (array of dependency plugin names)

### New Plugin Source Enum:
```prisma
enum PluginSource {
  MARKETPLACE
  GIT_REPOSITORY
  NPM_REGISTRY
  LOCAL_FILE
  DOCKER_REGISTRY
  INTERNAL
  CUSTOM
}
```

## New Models Added

### 1. PluginOperation
Tracks all operations performed on plugins (install, update, configure, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Operation history and audit trail
- **Key Features**: Status tracking, retry logic, performance metrics
- **Indexes**: Optimized for status queries, user operations, and environment filtering

### 2. PluginMetrics  
Time-series metrics storage for plugin performance monitoring
- **Purpose**: Performance and usage analytics
- **Key Features**: Flexible metric types, environment isolation, time-based queries
- **Indexes**: Optimized for time-series queries and metric aggregation

### 3. PluginConfig
Enhanced configuration storage with validation and secrets management
- **Purpose**: Centralized configuration management
- **Key Features**: Type validation, secret encryption, environment isolation
- **Indexes**: Optimized for configuration retrieval and secret filtering

### 4. Enhanced PluginDependency
Improved dependency management with conflict resolution
- **Purpose**: Dependency tracking and validation
- **Key Features**: Version ranges, conflict detection, runtime vs dev dependencies
- **Indexes**: Optimized for dependency resolution and status checking

## Performance Optimizations

### Multi-Tenant Indexes
- Tenant-based plugin queries with status filtering
- Environment-scoped operations and configurations
- Resource usage tracking per tenant

### Composite Indexes
- Plugin operations by environment and type
- Plugin metrics for time-series queries
- Configuration retrieval by environment and key
- Alert management by severity and status

### Partial Indexes
- Installed and enabled plugins only
- Unsatisfied dependencies for faster conflict resolution
- Non-secret configurations for faster reads

## Data Integrity Features

### Constraints
- Unique constraints for plugin names per tenant
- Foreign key relationships with proper CASCADE/RESTRICT options
- Check constraints for enum values and numeric ranges

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Tenant ID filtering on all plugin-related queries
- Row-level security considerations documented
- Proper data isolation for sensitive operations

## Production-Ready Features

### Backup and Recovery
- Plugin backup management with multiple storage providers
- Restore point tracking with verification
- Automated retention policies

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Plugin health monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Performance metrics with percentile tracking
- Security vulnerability scanning and tracking

### Audit and Compliance
- Complete operation audit trail
- Plugin analytics for usage tracking
- Approval workflow management for governance

## Recommended Database Optimizations

### Indexes to Create Manually (if needed):
```sql
-- Time-series optimization for metrics
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_plugin_metrics_timeseries 
ON plugin_metrics (plugin_id, metric_name, timestamp DESC);

-- Tenant isolation optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_plugins_tenant_status_health 
ON plugins (tenant_id, status, health_score) 
WHERE tenant_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Plugin operations performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_plugin_operations_env_type_status 
ON plugin_operations (environment, operation_type, status, started_at);
```

### Data Retention Policies:
- Plugin metrics: 90 days retention
- Completed operations: 30 days retention  
- Analytics data: 1 year retention
- Audit logs: 2 years retention

## Migration Considerations

### Breaking Changes:
- None - all changes are additive to existing models

### New Relationships:
- Plugin -> PluginOperation (one-to-many)
- Plugin -> PluginMetrics (one-to-many)  
- Plugin -> PluginConfig (one-to-many)
- Enhanced PluginDependency with additional fields

### Database Size Impact:
- Expect 20-30% increase in database size with full feature adoption
- Time-series metrics will be the largest data contributor
- Implement data retention policies to manage growth

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migration**: `npx prisma db push` or `npma prisma migrate dev`
2. **Update Application Code**: Adapt services to use new models
3. **Configure Monitoring**: Set up health check and metrics collection
4. **Implement Data Retention**: Create automated cleanup jobs
5. **Enable Row-Level Security**: Configure tenant isolation policies

## Validation Status
âœ… Schema validation passed: The schema is syntactically correct and ready for deployment.
