# ADR-002: Microservices Architecture Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system needs to support multiple teams, rapid development cycles, and independent deployment of features. We need to decide between monolithic and microservices architecture patterns.

## Decision
We will implement a **microservices architecture** with the following service boundaries:

### Core Services
1. **Portal Frontend Service** - Next.js application serving the main UI
2. **Backstage Backend Service** - Core IDP functionality
3. **Plugin Registry Service** - Plugin lifecycle management
4. **Workflow Engine Service** - Automation and orchestration
5. **User Management Service** - Authentication and authorization
6. **Notification Service** - Real-time notifications and alerts

### Supporting Services
1. **Search Service** - Elasticsearch-based search functionality
2. **Monitoring Service** - Metrics collection and health checks
3. **Audit Service** - Compliance and audit trail logging
4. **File Storage Service** - Document and artifact management

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use appropriate technologies
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work on services independently
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't affect others
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Distributed systems complexity (network calls, data consistency)
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
- **Development Overhead**: Service discovery, communication protocols
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing becomes more complex

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use service mesh (Istio) for service-to-service communication
- Implement circuit breakers and retry logic
- Use distributed tracing for debugging
- Establish clear API contracts between services
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting

# ADR-003: Event-Driven Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system needs to handle real-time updates, plugin lifecycle events, workflow state changes, and user notifications. We need a reliable way to handle asynchronous communication between services.

## Decision
We will implement an **event-driven architecture** using:

### Event Infrastructure
- **Redis Pub/Sub** for lightweight, real-time events
- **Apache Kafka** for durable, high-throughput event streaming
- **WebSocket connections** for real-time UI updates
- **Webhooks** for external system integration

### Event Categories
1. **System Events**: Service health, deployment status, infrastructure changes
2. **Plugin Events**: Installation, updates, configuration changes, lifecycle events
3. **User Events**: Authentication, authorization, profile updates
4. **Workflow Events**: Execution status, approvals, completions
5. **Integration Events**: External system synchronization, data updates

### Event Schema
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  source: string;
  timestamp: string;
  version: string;
  data: Record<string, any>;
  metadata: {
    correlationId?: string;
    userId?: string;
    organizationId?: string;
  };
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate propagation of state changes
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't need direct dependencies
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing handles load spikes
- **Auditability**: Complete event history for compliance
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new event consumers

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Event ordering, duplicate handling, error recovery
- **Debugging**: Distributed event flows are harder to trace
- **Data Consistency**: Eventually consistent model
- **Infrastructure**: Additional components to manage

### Implementation Guidelines
- Use event sourcing for critical business logic
- Implement event versioning for schema evolution
- Use idempotent event handlers
- Implement dead letter queues for error handling

# ADR-004: Database Strategy and Data Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system needs to handle various data types, ensure ACID compliance for critical operations, provide fast read access, and support full-text search capabilities.

## Decision
We will implement a **polyglot persistence strategy** with:

### Primary Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Use Cases**: Transactional data, user accounts, plugin metadata, workflow definitions
- **Features**: ACID compliance, complex queries, JSON support, full-text search
- **Configuration**: Multi-master setup with read replicas for scalability

### Caching Layer (Redis)
- **Use Cases**: Session management, API response caching, real-time data
- **Features**: In-memory performance, pub/sub messaging, data structures
- **Configuration**: Cluster mode with automatic failover

### Search Engine (Elasticsearch)
- **Use Cases**: Full-text search, analytics, log aggregation
- **Features**: Distributed search, real-time indexing, analytics
- **Configuration**: Multi-node cluster with proper shard distribution

### Secret Management (HashiCorp Vault)
- **Use Cases**: API keys, database credentials, certificates, encryption keys
- **Features**: Dynamic secrets, encryption as a service, audit logging
- **Configuration**: High availability mode with auto-unsealing

### Data Access Patterns
```typescript
// Repository Pattern Implementation
interface PluginRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<Plugin>;
  findByQuery(query: PluginQuery): Promise<Plugin[]>;
  create(plugin: CreatePluginRequest): Promise<Plugin>;
  update(id: string, updates: UpdatePluginRequest): Promise<Plugin>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}

// Caching Strategy
interface CacheService {
  get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null>;
  set<T>(key: string, value: T, ttl?: number): Promise<void>;
  invalidate(pattern: string): Promise<void>;
  invalidateByTags(tags: string[]): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: Right tool for each data type and access pattern
- **Reliability**: ACID compliance where needed, eventual consistency where acceptable
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling of different data stores
- **Security**: Centralized secret management and encryption

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple data stores to maintain and monitor
- **Consistency**: Data synchronization between stores
- **Operational Overhead**: More backup and recovery procedures

### Data Consistency Strategy
- Use database transactions for critical business operations
- Implement eventual consistency for less critical data
- Use event-driven synchronization between data stores
- Implement conflict resolution strategies

# ADR-005: Security Architecture and Zero Trust Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system handles sensitive developer tools, intellectual property, and integrates with critical infrastructure. We need enterprise-grade security that meets compliance requirements.

## Decision
We will implement a **Zero Trust security model** with:

### Authentication Strategy
- **Multi-factor Authentication** (MFA) required for all users
- **Single Sign-On** (SSO) integration with enterprise identity providers
- **API Key Management** for programmatic access
- **Service-to-Service Authentication** using mutual TLS and JWT tokens

### Authorization Strategy
- **Role-Based Access Control** (RBAC) for user permissions
- **Attribute-Based Access Control** (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions
- **Policy-as-Code** using Open Policy Agent (OPA)
- **Just-in-Time Access** for privileged operations

### Network Security
- **Service Mesh** (Istio) with mutual TLS for all service communication
- **Network Policies** to restrict pod-to-pod communication
- **Web Application Firewall** (WAF) for external traffic
- **DDoS Protection** and rate limiting

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest** for all data stores
- **Encryption in Transit** for all network communication
- **Data Loss Prevention** (DLP) scanning
- **Regular Security Scanning** of containers and dependencies

### Security Implementation
```yaml
# Security Policy Example
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: plugin-registry-policy
  namespace: developer-portal
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: plugin-registry
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals: ["cluster.local/ns/developer-portal/sa/portal-frontend"]
    to:
    - operation:
        methods: ["GET", "POST"]
        paths: ["/api/plugins/*"]
    when:
    - key: request.headers[authorization]
      values: ["Bearer *"]
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Compliance**: Meets SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR requirements
- **Auditability**: Complete audit trail of all operations
- **Threat Detection**: Real-time security monitoring

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Complex security policies and configurations
