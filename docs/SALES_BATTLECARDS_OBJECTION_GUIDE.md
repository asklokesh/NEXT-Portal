Should we plan for a Q2 implementation, or would Q3 work better with your current priorities?" **Variations**: - "What size pilot team would you like to start with?" - "Would you prefer the Enterprise or Enterprise Plus tier for your initial deployment?" - "Should we schedule the technical deep-dive for next week?" ### URGENCY CLOSE **Usage**: When there's a compelling business driver or deadline **Script**: "You mentioned the need to improve productivity before the Q2 product launch. NextPortal's 30-day implementation would give you 60 days of productivity gains before that deadline. What would need to happen to get started this month?" **Variations**: - "Every month of delay costs $191K in productivity losses for your team size" - "Your competitors might be addressing this same challenge - timing could be critical" - "We have implementation slots available in [timeframe] but they're filling up quickly" ### ALTERNATIVES CLOSE **Usage**: When the prospect seems indecisive or wants to compare options **Script**: "It sounds like you have three options: continue with your current tools and accept the productivity limitations, spend 6+ months implementing Backstage with your engineering team, or get enterprise results immediately with NextPortal. Which approach aligns best with your business objectives?" **Variations**: - "You can either build this capability internally or buy it from us - which makes more sense given your priorities?" - "Would you rather invest your engineering resources in platform infrastructure or product features?" ### TRIAL CLOSE **Usage**: Throughout the conversation to gauge interest and identify concerns **Scripts**: - "How does this sound so far?" - "What questions or concerns do you have about what we've discussed?" - "If we could address [specific concern], would you be ready to move forward?" - "On a scale of 1-10, how interested are you in solving this problem?" ### CONCESSION CLOSE **Usage**: When price or terms are a sticking point **Script**: "I understand budget is a concern. If I could work with my team to include [additional service/discount/flexible terms] in the package, would that help you move forward?" **Common Concessions**: - Extended pilot period - Flexible payment terms - Additional professional services - Custom integrations - Volume discounts for multi-year contracts ### SUMMARY CLOSE **Usage**: At the end of a comprehensive presentation or discussion **Script**: "Let me summarize what we've covered: NextPortal solves your developer productivity challenge, delivers 35% improvement with proven ROI, integrates with your existing tools, and can be implemented in 30 days. The investment pays for itself in 2.2 months. What questions do you have, and what are the next steps to move forward?" ### REFERRAL CLOSE **Usage**: When the prospect wants additional validation **Script**: "I understand you want to hear from customers in similar situations. I'll arrange calls with two customers: one in your industry who achieved similar results, and one with comparable team size. After those conversations, assuming you're satisfied with what you hear, are you ready to move forward?" ### FEAR OF LOSS CLOSE **Usage**: When competition is involved or timing is critical **Script**: "Based on your timeline and the competitive landscape, waiting another quarter could put you at a significant disadvantage. Your competitors are likely addressing these same productivity challenges. What would it cost your business if they achieve 35% faster delivery while you're still evaluating options?" --- ## SALES PROCESS CHECKPOINTS ### QUALIFICATION CHECKLIST **BANT Qualification**: - [ ] **Budget**: Confirmed budget range and approval authority - [ ] **Authority**: Identified decision maker and influencers - [ ] **Need**: Clear business pain and compelling event - [ ] **Timeline**: Defined evaluation and implementation timeline **MEDDIC Qualification**: - [ ] **Metrics**: Quantified business impact and success criteria - [ ] **Economic Buyer**: Identified ultimate decision maker - [ ] **Decision Criteria**: Understood evaluation criteria and process - [ ] **Decision Process**: Mapped decision-making process and timeline - [ ] **Implicate Pain**: Identified compelling business pain - [ ] **Champion**: Secured internal advocate with influence ### STAKEHOLDER MAPPING **Key Roles to Identify**: - **Economic Buyer**: Ultimate budget authority (CTO, CIO, VP Engineering) - **Technical Champion**: Internal advocate with technical influence - **End User**: Developer teams who will use the platform - **Procurement**: Legal/procurement involvement in vendor selection - **Security**: CISO or security team approval required - **Compliance**: Regulatory or compliance stakeholder input ### OPPORTUNITY PROGRESSION MILESTONES **Stage 1: Initial Interest** - [ ] Pain and need identified - [ ] Initial stakeholders engaged - [ ] Discovery call completed - [ ] Budget range confirmed **Stage 2: Evaluation** - [ ] Technical demonstration completed - [ ] Stakeholder presentations delivered - [ ] References provided and called - [ ] Proposal submitted **Stage 3: Decision** - [ ] Final decision criteria met - [ ] Competition eliminated or positioned - [ ] Business case approved - [ ] Contract negotiation initiated **Stage 4: Close** - [ ] Contract terms agreed - [ ] Implementation timeline confirmed - [ ] Success criteria defined - [ ] Contract executed --- **Document Classification**: Internal Sales Tool **Version**: 1.0 **Last Updated**: January 15, 2025 **Usage**: Sales team competitive and objection handling **Distribution**: Sales organization only
