## üìû Executive Communication

### For Leadership Team:
"The platform architecture and feature set are genuinely impressive and competitive. However, we need 4-6 weeks to get the infrastructure operational and properly validated before we can confidently engage Fortune 500 customers. The investment is sound, but timing expectations need adjustment."

### For Engineering Team:
"Outstanding architectural work. Focus immediately on infrastructure stabilization - get PostgreSQL, Redis, and Backstage services operational. Once that's done, we have a genuinely competitive enterprise platform."

### For Sales Team:
"The platform will be genuinely competitive once operational. Adjust customer expectations for a Q1 2026 GA timeline rather than immediate availability. Use this time to build pipeline and validate customer requirements."
